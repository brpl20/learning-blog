# Mindset
- We should fear obscurity. It's worse than doing nothing - Seth Godin
- If you're not zigging, you're laggin - Marty Neumeier

# SelfCoaching Model
1. Circumstances => Entregar vídeos de qualidade 
2. Thoughts => Muita coisa pra fazer, não tenho tempo! 
3. Feelings => Ansiedade - Urgência 
4. Actions => Pensar em tudo que pode ser feito, criar processos criativos. 
5. Results => Dificuldades e procrastinação - Produzir conteúdos ruins

1. Entregar vídeos de qualidade
2. Parece difícil, mas já fiz coisas mais difíceis ainda
3. Relaxado 
4. Planejo, executo minhas ações de acordo com o tempo plnejado  - Quebro o problema em pequenos pedaços 
5. Evoluo constantemente 

## Assigment 
1. Write on paper for +10 minuts without correction yourself
2. Identify a specific limiting belief and run it through the self-coaching model 
3. Challenge this beliefe with an alternative model
